# Serverless Playground
This playground is a project for building Serverless workflow with OpenFaaS and Kubernetes. Any code supported by OpenFaaS can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

## Features
- Run serverless apps without provisioning or managing servers
- Ease of use through UI portal + monaco-editor, and one-click install
- Write functions in any language supported by OpenFaaS  (such as Node.js, Python, CSharp and Ruby) and package in Docker/OCI image format
- Coordinate multiple functions into serverless workflows so you can build and update serverless apps quickly.
- Event-driven architecture
- Manage streaming workloads and leveraging service meshes using Istio
