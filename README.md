# Serverless Playground
This playground is a project for building Serverless functions with Docker and Kubernetes which has first-class support for metrics. Any Spark Job can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

## Features
- Run code without provisioning or managing servers
- Ease of use through UI portal and one-click install
- Write job functions in any language supported by Apache Spark (Java, Python, R, Scala) and package in Docker/OCI image format
- Coordinate multiple job functions into serverless workflows so you can build and update bigdata apps quickly.
- Event-driven architecture
- Manage streaming workloads and leveraging service meshes using Istio
